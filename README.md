# PID Controller Implementation for 2-Link Robotic Manipulator

## Abstract
This project presents a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller designed for a traditional 2-link robotic manipulator. It commences by delineating the manipulator's equations of motion and then concentrates on achieving desired positions using computed torque control. MATLAB is utilized for conducting control simulations, evaluating performance under Proportional-Derivative (PD), Proportional-Integral (PI), and PID control schemes with varying control gains. Results are analyzed using MATLAB's SIMULINK, discussing the strengths and limitations of each control model.
